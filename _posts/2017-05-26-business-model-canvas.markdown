### What’s the Business Model Canvas?

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management and lean startup template
for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart
with elements describing a firm’s or product’s value proposition, infrastructure,
customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating
potential trade-offs.
The Business Model Canvas was initially proposed by Alexander Osterwalder
based on his earlier work on Business Model Ontology

Business Model Canvas adopters include a wide range of Fortune 500 and FT Global 500 companies, as well as other leading global organizations around the world. Applications span from strategic reorientation and building entirely new businesses at the corporate level, all the way to better understanding of B2B clients and on-boarding senior executives and new employees.

### The Business Model Canvas (BMC) gives you the structure of a business plan

You can use the canvas to describe, design, challenge, and pivot your business model.

## Building Blocks Overview

- Customer Segments: Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do?
- Value Propositions: What’s compelling about the proposition? Why do customers buy, use?
- Channels: How are these propositions promoted, sold and delivered? Why? Is it working?
- Customer Relationships: How do you interact with the customer through their ‘journey’?
- Revenue Streams: How does the business earn revenue from the value propositions?
- Key Activities: What uniquely strategic things does the business do to deliver its proposition?
- Key Resources: What unique strategic assets must the business have to compete?
- Key Partnerships: What can the company not do so it can focus on its Key Activities?
- Cost Structure: What are the business’ major cost drivers? How are they linked to revenue?

#### 14 Ways to Apply the Canvas

## Design Thinking & Customer Development

Design Thinking is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems, and find desirable solutions
for clients. A design mindset is not problem-focused, it’s solution focused and action oriented towards creating a
preferred future. Design thinking seeks to build ideas up.

“Design thinking can be described as a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity.” – Tim Brown CEO, IDEO

## Customer Development

Developed by Steve Blank, customer development is the practice of gaining customer insights to generate,
test, and optimize ideas for products and services through interviews and structured experiments. Customer
development is used to help build products that customers want and avoid spending time and money on
products customers don’t want.

## Evidence Based Entrepreneurship
Hypotheses – Experiments – Tests – Insights.

New ventures (both startups and new ideas in existing companies) don’t start with “ideas”, they start with hypotheses (a fancy word for guesses.) It’s important to understand that the words “idea ” and “hypotheses” mean two very different things. For most innovators the word “idea” conjures up an insight that immediately requires a plan to bring it to fruition. In contrast, a hypothesis means we have an educated guess that requires experimentation and data to validate or invalidate.

#### Insights = Lessons Learned

“Lessons Learned” day allows us to directly assess the ability of the team to learn, pivot and move forward. Based on the “lessons learned” we generate an Investment Readiness Level metric that we can use as part of our “go” or “no-go” decision for funding.
