Customer Segments

1. Segment Dimensions
Do you have a single or multi-sided market? If you have a multi-sided market you’ll have at least as many segments as you have sides.

2. Segment Composition If the segment dimensions are the ‘macro’ analysis of
your customer base, then looking within each segment
at individual customer types as ‘Personas’ is the
‘micro’.

3. Problems, Needs, Habits & Current Alternatives
What job are you doing for the customer? What need
are you fulfilling?
If you’re not sure, go out and observe, talk to some
representative people.
Who would you pitch first if you could only pitch one?
Who next?
